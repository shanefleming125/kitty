          <p class="bio">Seymour was found as a kitten sitting on a street corner all by himself. My sister's friend found him and brought him over to the house.
            At this point we only had a pet rabbit and my mom did not want a cat. Seymour used his natural charisma to win over my parents and became a
            part of the family. He also became fast friends with my pet rabbit Rupert.</p>

          <p class="bio">Mister Po followed one of my other cats home (RIP Filbert) and at first was afraid of humans. It took me about four
            months to slowly sneak up on him while he was sleeping. When I finally petted him, he rolled over and started purring which is the universal cat-human
            adoption contract. Po is an outdoor cat (because my other cats hate him) and he sits on my porch all day in his chair. He has a fan club of neighborhood
            kids and old people who come and visit him.

          <p class="bio">Haru was adopted from a friend of a friend who had a litter of kittens. We adopted Haru and her brother Rufus (RIP Rufus). I was only supposed
            to adopt one kitten but they both played so well together that I took them both home and faced the wrath of my parents. #worthit Haru is obsessed with Professor
            Thompson and Professor Thompson only. She is the #1 hater of Po and is the master of the house. Even though she may be intimidating to both humans and cats,
            she is really squishy.

          <p class="bio">Winnie was found by my friends co-worker in a bush in Manhattan Beach when she was walking her dog. She is a professional coat
            groomer and has the softest fur. Winnie is a "forever kitten" being unusually small for her age. She also has hip dysplasia so she doesn't jump
            very well for a cat. She hates when people whistle and is known to either bite or lick whoever is whistling. She is also obsessed with me
            and rarely leaves my side.

            suits her. She is the baby of the cat squad but loves to take on the older cats in play wrestling matches. Walter really likes Mister Po and
            tries to sneak out the door to see him. She is very friendly and enjoys meeting new people. She also enjoys "helping" you make the bed.
